==================

Stashing octave-related crapola here.  Probably not of much
use to anyone else, but hey, you never know.

License: GPL for anything that's code, GPL or GFDL for anything that's
documentation.

Really this was just an excuse to waste some time making a cheatsheet,
and then, since I made one, it might as well get put someplace.
